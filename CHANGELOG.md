## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-16

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 1.07x (Calor leads)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 8, C# wins 4
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 1.55x (Calor wins, large effect)

- All 40 benchmark files now compile successfully

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-12

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 0.84x (C# leads on token economics)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 7, C# wins 4
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 1.57x (Calor wins, large effect)
  - ErrorDetection: 1.51x (Calor wins, large effect)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.50x (Calor wins, large effect)
  - EditPrecision: 1.38x (Calor wins, large effect)
  - ContractVerification, EffectSoundness, InteropEffectCoverage: Calor-only features (C# has no equivalent)
- **Programs Tested**: 36

### Added
- **Platform-specific VS Code extension bundles** - Each platform (Windows x64/ARM64, macOS x64/ARM64, Linux x64/ARM64) gets its own VSIX with bundled language server binary (~40 MB each)
- **Bundled language server discovery** - Extension automatically uses bundled `calor-lsp` binary, no separate installation needed
- **Enum extension methods** - `§EEXT{id:EnumName}` for defining extension methods on enums

### Changed
- Enum definitions now use `§EN{id:name}` instead of `§ENUM{id:name}` (both are accepted for backwards compatibility)
- CI workflow now builds 6 platform-specific VSIX packages in parallel

### Fixed
- Benchmark framework now correctly counts Calor-only metrics (ContractVerification, EffectSoundness, InteropEffectCoverage) as Calor wins instead of ties
