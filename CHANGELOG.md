# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Enum extension methods** - `§EXT{id:EnumName}` for defining extension methods on enums
- **Shorter enum syntax** - `§EN` as shorthand for `§ENUM` (legacy syntax still supported)

### Changed
- Enum definitions now use `§EN{id:name}` instead of `§ENUM{id:name}` (both are accepted for backwards compatibility)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-10

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 0.84x (C# leads on token economics)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 7, C# wins 4
- **Highlights**:
  - Comprehension: 1.57x (Calor wins)
  - ErrorDetection: 1.51x (Calor wins)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.50x (Calor wins)
  - EditPrecision: 1.38x (Calor wins)
  - ContractVerification, EffectSoundness, InteropEffectCoverage: Calor-exclusive features (not available in C#)
- **Programs Tested**: 36

### Added
- **Collection operations with semantic type checking** - `§LIST`, `§DICT`, `§HSET` literals with `§PUSH`, `§PUT`, `§SETIDX`, `§HAS`, `§CNT` operations
- **Pattern matching with arrow syntax** - `§W`/`§K` switch expressions with relational patterns (`§PREL`), variable patterns (`§VAR`), guards (`§WHEN`)
- **Async/await support** - `§AF`/`§AMT` for async functions/methods, `§AWAIT` expression with ConfigureAwait support
- **Lambda expressions** - Inline `(x) → expr` and block `§LAM`/`§/LAM` syntax with async support
- **Delegate definitions** - `§DEL`/`§/DEL` for custom delegate types with effect tracking
- **Event support** - `§EVT` for event definitions, `§SUB`/`§UNSUB` for subscribe/unsubscribe
- **Dictionary iteration** - `§EACHKV` for iterating key-value pairs

### Fixed
- Z3 SMT solver contract inheritance verification gaps
- Type checker for angle bracket generic syntax

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-08

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 0.80x (C# leads overall)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 4, C# wins 4
- **Highlights**:
  - ErrorDetection: 1.55x (Calor wins, large effect)
  - Comprehension: 1.49x (Calor wins, large effect)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.49x (Calor wins, large effect)
  - EditPrecision: 1.36x (Calor wins, large effect)
- **Programs Tested**: 28

### Added
- **Z3 static contract verification** - Prove contracts at compile time with `--verify` flag; proven contracts can have runtime checks elided
- **Manifest-based effect resolution for .NET interop** - Layered resolution from built-in BCL manifests, user manifests, and namespace defaults
- **Granular effect taxonomy** - `fs:r/fs:w`, `net:r/net:w`, `db:r/db:w`, `env:r/env:w` with subtyping (`rw` encompasses `r` and `w`)
- **New CLI commands**: `calor effects resolve`, `calor effects validate`, `calor effects list`
- New CatchBugs component on homepage showing interprocedural effect analysis with compiler error demo

### Changed
- Homepage restructured from 9 to 7 sections for better focus
- Hero updated with value-oriented messaging ("When AI writes your code, the language should catch the bugs")
- CodeComparison updated with ULID-based stable identifiers
- FeatureGrid updated with impact statements and "Learn more" links for all cards
- BenchmarkChart reframed as "Where Explicit Semantics Pay Off"
- QuickStart now includes descriptions under each command
- ProjectStatus now compact with chip-based milestones

### Removed
- Story section from homepage
- CompetitivePositioning section from homepage
- VSCodeExtension section from homepage

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-07

### Benchmark Results (Statistical: 30 runs)
- **Overall Advantage**: 0.80x (C# leads overall)
- **Metrics**: Calor wins 4, C# wins 4
- **Highlights**:
  - ErrorDetection: 1.55x (Calor wins, large effect)
  - Comprehension: 1.49x (Calor wins, large effect)
  - RefactoringStability: 1.49x (Calor wins, large effect)
  - EditPrecision: 1.36x (Calor wins, large effect)
- **Programs Tested**: 28

### Fixed
- Benchmark calculators now use correct curly brace syntax `{` for Calor patterns instead of square brackets `[`
- This fix enables proper detection of Calor language constructs in RefactoringStability, Comprehension, ErrorDetection, and EditPrecision metrics

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-06

### Changed
- Documentation updated to remove v1/v2 version references
