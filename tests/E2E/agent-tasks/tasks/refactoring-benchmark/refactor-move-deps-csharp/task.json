Abs should be in UtilsModule with its postcondition comment preserved\n2. Distance should call the moved Abs method\n\nYou'll need to either:\n- Create an instance of UtilsModule to call the method, OR\n- Make Abs a static method and call UtilsModule.Abs(...)\n\nChoose the approach that results in cleaner code.",
