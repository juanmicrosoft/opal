Distance (f003) should call Abs using the appropriate syntax\n\nDistance currently calls Abs:\n§R §C{Abs}\n    §A (+ (* x x) (* y y))\n  §/C\n\nAfter move, update the call if needed to reference the function in its new location.\n\nIMPORTANT: Both function IDs (f001 and f003) must be preserved. The postconditions on both functions must be preserved.",
