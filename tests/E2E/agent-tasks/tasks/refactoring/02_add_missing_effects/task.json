The function should properly declare all required effects.\n\nCreate this function with proper effect declarations:\n§F{f001:ProcessAndLog:pub}\n  §I{str:path}\n  §O{void}\n  §E{fs:r,cw}\n  §B{content} §C{File.ReadAllText}\n    §A path\n  §/C\n  §C{Console.WriteLine}\n    §A content\n  §/C\n§/F{f001}\n\nKey point: The function uses both file read (fs:r) and console write (cw) effects, so both must be declared in §E{fs:r,cw}. Calor's effect system enforces this.",
