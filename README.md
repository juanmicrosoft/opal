# Calor
> Coding Agent Language for Optimized Reasoning
<br/>
A programming language designed specifically for AI coding agents, compiling to .NET via C# emission.

## Why Calor Exists

AI coding agents are transforming software development, but they're forced to work with languages designed for humans. This creates a fundamental mismatch:

**AI agents need to understand code semantically** — what it does, what side effects it has, what contracts it upholds — but traditional languages hide this information behind syntax that requires deep semantic analysis to parse.

Calor asks: *What if we designed a language from the ground up for AI agents?*

### The Core Insight

When an AI agent reads code, it needs answers to specific questions:
- What does this function **do**? (not just how it's implemented)
- What are the **side effects**? (I/O, state mutations, network calls)
- What **constraints** must hold? (preconditions, postconditions)
- How do I **precisely reference** this code element across edits?
- Where does this **scope end**?

Traditional languages make agents *infer* these answers through complex analysis. Calor makes them *explicit* in the syntax.

## What Makes Calor Different

| Principle | How Calor Implements It | Agent Benefit |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Explicit over implicit** | Effects declared with `§E{cw, fs:r, net:rw}` | Know side effects without reading implementation |
| **Contracts are code** | First-class `§Q` (requires) and `§S` (ensures) | Generate tests from specs, verify correctness |
| **Everything has an ID** | `§F{f001:Main}`, `§L{l001:i:1:100:1}` | Precise references that survive refactoring |
| **Unambiguous structure** | Matched tags `§F{}...§/F{}` | Parse without semantic analysis |
| **Machine-readable semantics** | Lisp-style operators `(+ a b)` | Symbolic manipulation without text parsing |

### Side-by-Side: What Agents See

**Calor** — Everything explicit:
```
§F{f002:Square:pub}
  §I{i32:x}
  §O{i32}
  §Q (>= x 0)
  §S (>= result 0)
  §R (* x x)
§/F{f002}
```

**C#** — Contracts buried in implementation:
```csharp
public static int Square(int x)
{
    if (!(x >= 0))
        throw new ArgumentException("Precondition failed");
    var result = x * x;
    if (!(result >= 0))
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Postcondition failed");
    return result;
}
```

**What Calor tells the agent directly:**
- Function ID: `f002`, can reference precisely
- Precondition (`§Q`): `x >= 0`
- Postcondition (`§S`): `result >= 0`
- No side effects (no `§E` declaration)

**What C# requires the agent to infer:**
- Parse exception patterns to find contracts
- Understand that lack of I/O calls *probably* means no side effects
- Hope line numbers don't change across edits

## The Tradeoff

Calor deliberately trades token efficiency for semantic explicitness:

```
C#:   return a + b;    // 4 tokens, implicit semantics
Calor: §R (+ a b)       // Explicit Lisp-style operations
```

This tradeoff pays off when:
- Agents need to **reason** about code behavior
- Agents need to **detect** contract violations
- Agents need to **edit** specific code elements precisely
- Code correctness matters more than brevity

### Benchmark Results

Calor shows measurable advantages in AI agent comprehension, error detection, edit precision, and refactoring stability. C# wins on token efficiency, reflecting a fundamental tradeoff: explicit semantics require more tokens but enable better agent reasoning.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the compiler
dotnet tool install -g calor

# Initialize for Claude Code (run in a folder with a C# project or solution)
calor init --ai claude

# Compile Calor to C#
calor --input program.calr --output program.g.cs
```

### Your First Calor Program

```
§M{m001:Hello}
§F{f001:Main:pub}
  §O{void}
  §E{cw}
  §P "Hello from Calor!"
§/F{f001}
§/M{m001}
```

Save as `hello.calr`, then:

```bash
calor --input hello.calr --output hello.g.cs
```

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juanmicrosoft/calor.git
cd calor && dotnet build

# Run the sample
dotnet run --project src/Calor.Compiler -- \
  --input samples/HelloWorld/hello.calr \
  --output samples/HelloWorld/hello.g.cs
dotnet run --project samples/HelloWorld
```
