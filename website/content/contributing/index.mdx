## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow existing code patterns
- Use meaningful names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused

### Pull Requests

- Describe what the PR does
- Include test coverage for new features
- Update documentation if needed

---

## Priority Areas

We're especially interested in contributions to:

### 1. Benchmark Corpus

The evaluation framework needs more programs:
- Different problem domains
- Varying complexity levels
- Edge cases for metrics

See [Adding Benchmarks](/contributing/adding-benchmarks/).

### 2. Documentation

- More code examples
- Tutorial content
- API documentation

### 3. Parser Edge Cases

The Calor parser needs testing with:
- Complex nested structures
- Edge case syntax
- Error recovery scenarios
