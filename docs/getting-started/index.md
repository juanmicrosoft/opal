# Getting Started with OPAL

This guide will help you install OPAL, write your first program, and understand how to integrate OPAL with AI coding agents.

---

## Quick Overview

OPAL is a programming language that compiles to C# via source-to-source transformation. The workflow is:

```
your_code.opal → OPAL Compiler → your_code.g.cs → .NET Build → executable
```

---

## What You'll Learn

1. **[Installation](/opal/getting-started/installation/)** - Set up the OPAL compiler
2. **[Hello World](/opal/getting-started/hello-world/)** - Write and run your first OPAL program
3. **[Claude Integration](/opal/getting-started/claude-integration/)** - Use OPAL with AI coding agents

---

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later
- A terminal or command prompt

---

## Two Paths to OPAL

Choose your starting point based on your situation:

### New Project

Get up and running with OPAL in one command:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juanmicrosoft/opal/main/scripts/init-opal.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juanmicrosoft/opal/main/scripts/init-opal.ps1 | iex
```

### Existing C# Project

Add OPAL to your existing codebase:

```bash
# 1. Find best migration candidates
opalc analyze ./src --top 10

# 2. Set up tooling and MSBuild integration
opalc init --ai claude

# 3. Start migrating files
opalc convert HighScoreFile.cs

# 4. Build - OPAL compiles automatically
dotnet build
```

See the [Adding OPAL to Existing Projects](/opal/guides/adding-opal-to-existing-projects/) guide for the complete walkthrough.

---

## What You Get

The init script (new projects) or `opalc init` (existing projects) sets up:

| Component | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| `opalc` global tool | Compile OPAL to C# from anywhere: `opalc --input file.opal --output file.g.cs` |
| Claude Code skills | Use `/opal` to write OPAL code and `/opal-convert` to convert C# to OPAL |
| MSBuild integration | `.opal` files compile automatically during `dotnet build` |
| Sample project | A ready-to-run OPAL project to explore (new projects only) |

---

## Manual Installation

For alternative installation methods (global tool only, manual Claude skills setup, or building from source), see the [Installation](/opal/getting-started/installation/) page.
