# Adding Calor to an Existing C# Project

This guide walks you through adding Calor to an existing C# project, from identifying migration candidates to building with mixed Calor/C# code.

---

## Overview

Adding Calor to an existing project is a gradual process:

1. **Initialize** - Enable Calor with MSBuild integration
2. **Analyze** - Find files that benefit most from Calor's features
3. **Write/Convert** - Create new files in Calor, convert high-scoring C# files
4. **Build** - Calor compiles automatically with your project

You don't need to convert everything at once. Calor and C# coexist seamlessly.

---

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- `calor` global tool installed: `dotnet tool install -g calor`
- An existing C# project

---

## Step 1: Enable Calor in Your Project

Enable Calor with MSBuild integration:

```bash
# Initialize Calor in your project
calor init

# Or specify a specific project file
calor init --project MyApp.csproj
```

### What Happens

Your `.csproj` is updated with MSBuild targets that:

- Compile `.calr` files automatically before C# compilation
- Include generated `.g.cs` files in the build
- Clean generated files on `dotnet clean`

Generated files go to `obj/<Configuration>/<TargetFramework>/calor/`, keeping your source tree clean.

After this step, you can immediately start writing `.calr` files and they'll compile during `dotnet build`.

---

## Step 2: Analyze Your Codebase

Use `calor assess` to find C# files that would benefit most from Calor:

```bash
# Analyze your source directory
calor assess ./src

# Show top 10 candidates with detailed scores
calor assess ./src --top 10 --verbose
```

### Understanding the Output

```
=== Calor Migration Assessment ===

Analyzed: 42 files
Average Score: 34.2/100

Top 10 Files for Migration:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 82/100 [Critical]  src/Services/PaymentProcessor.cs
 78/100 [Critical]  src/Services/OrderService.cs
 65/100 [High]      src/Repositories/UserRepository.cs
 58/100 [High]      src/Validators/InputValidator.cs
...
```

Files are scored based on patterns that map to Calor features:

| Pattern | Calor Feature |
|:--------|:-------------|
| Argument validation, `ArgumentException` | `§Q` precondition contracts |
| Null checks, `?.`, `??` | `Option<T>` types |
| Try/catch blocks | `Result<T,E>` error handling |
| File I/O, network, database calls | `§E` effect declarations |

### Priority Bands

| Priority | Score | Recommendation |
|:---------|:------|:---------------|
| **Critical** | 76-100 | Convert to Calor - high benefit |
| **High** | 51-75 | Good conversion candidate |
| **Medium** | 26-50 | Optional - some benefit |
| **Low** | 0-25 | Keep in C# - minimal benefit |

---

## Step 3: Add Your First Calor File

Create a new `.calr` file alongside your existing code:

```bash
# Create a simple Calor module
cat > src/Services/Calculator.calr << 'EOF'
§M{m001:Calculator}

§F{f001:Add:pub}
  §I{i32:a}
  §I{i32:b}
  §O{i32}
  §R (+ a b)
§/F{f001}

§F{f002:Divide:pub}
  §I{i32:a}
  §I{i32:b}
  §O{i32}
  §Q (!= b 0)
  §R (/ a b)
§/F{f002}

§/M{m001}
EOF
```

---

## Step 4: Build and Verify

```bash
# Build your project - Calor compiles automatically
dotnet build
```

The build process:

1. Finds all `.calr` files in your project
2. Compiles each to `.g.cs` in the `obj/calor/` directory
3. Includes generated C# in the normal compilation
4. Produces your final assembly

### Verify the Generated Code

Check the generated C# to understand what Calor produces:

```bash
cat obj/Debug/net8.0/calor/Calculator.g.cs
```

---

## Step 5: Convert High-Scoring C# Files

Based on your analysis results, convert files that score High or Critical:

```bash
# Convert a single file
calor convert src/Services/PaymentProcessor.cs

# Output: src/Services/PaymentProcessor.calr

# With benchmark comparison to see token savings
calor convert src/Services/PaymentProcessor.cs --benchmark
```

For bulk conversion:

```bash
# Preview what would be converted
calor migrate ./src --dry-run

# Convert all files
calor migrate ./src --direction cs-to-calor

# Generate a migration report
calor migrate ./src --report migration-report.md
```

---

## Step 6: Remove Original C# Files (Optional)

Once you've verified the Calor version works correctly:

```bash
# Remove the original C# file
rm src/Services/PaymentProcessor.cs

# The Calor file now produces the generated C# during build
```

Or keep both if you want to compare them during a transition period.

---

## Optional: Enable Claude Code Integration

For AI-assisted Calor development, add Claude Code support:

```bash
calor init --ai claude
```

### What Gets Added

| File | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| `.claude/skills/calor/SKILL.md` | Skill for writing Calor code |
| `.claude/skills/calor-convert/SKILL.md` | Skill for C# to Calor conversion |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project guidelines for Claude |

### CLAUDE.md Guidelines

The generated CLAUDE.md includes instructions that tell Claude to:

- **Write new files in Calor** instead of C#
- **Analyze C# files before modifying** - if a file scores High or Critical, convert it to Calor first, then make changes
- **Prefer Calor** for files with validation logic, error handling, or side effects

### Using Claude Code

After initialization, use these skills:

**Write new Calor code:**
```
/calor

Write a function that validates email addresses with:
- Precondition: input is not null or empty
- Postcondition: returns true only for valid emails
```

**Convert existing C# to Calor:**
```
/calor-convert src/Services/PaymentProcessor.cs
```

Claude will:
1. Read the C# file
2. Convert it to Calor syntax
3. Preserve all functionality
4. Add contracts where appropriate

**Refactor Calor code:**
```
Extract the validation logic from function f001 into a separate private function
```

Claude understands Calor's ID-based structure, so you can reference specific functions, loops, and conditionals by their IDs.

## Project Structure After Migration

A typical mixed project structure:

```
MyProject/
├── MyProject.csproj           # MSBuild with Calor targets
├── CLAUDE.md                  # Project docs for Claude
├── .claude/

```

## Best Practices

### What to Convert First

1. **High-scoring files** from `calor assess`
2. **Files with complex validation** - benefit from contracts
3. **Files with error handling** - benefit from `Result<T,E>`
4. **Files with side effects** - benefit from effect declarations

### What to Keep in C#

- Simple DTOs and record types
- Auto-generated code (EF migrations, gRPC stubs)
- Files with heavy framework integration
- Code using features Calor doesn't support yet

### Conversion Tips

- Convert one file at a time and verify it works
- Run your tests after each conversion
- Use `--benchmark` to see token savings
- Keep the original C# until you're confident in the Calor version

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails: "calor not found"

Add the .NET tools directory to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/tools"
```

### Generated Files Not Updating

Clean and rebuild:

```bash
dotnet clean
dotnet build
```

### Conversion Produces Warnings

The converter warns about patterns it can't perfectly translate:

```
Warning: Complex LINQ expression at line 42 - manual review recommended
```

Review these manually and adjust the Calor code as needed.

### Testing a Locally-Built Compiler

If you're developing changes to the Calor compiler itself, use `CalorCompilerOverride` to test your local build without modifying any project files:

```bash
dotnet build -p:CalorCompilerOverride=path/to/Calor.Compiler/bin/Debug/net8.0/calor
```

The build will emit a warning confirming the override is active. See [`calor init` - MSBuild Properties](/calor/cli/init/#msbuild-properties) for details.

### Test Failures After Conversion

1. Compare the generated C# with the original
2. Check that all method signatures match
3. Verify contracts aren't rejecting valid inputs
4. Look for subtle behavioral differences
