# Task Completion Metric

**Category:** Task Completion
**Result:** C# wins ([see current ratio](/calor/benchmarking/results/))
**What it measures:** End-to-end task success rates

---

## Overview

The Task Completion metric measures how successfully AI agents can complete full programming tasks, from understanding requirements to producing working code.

---

## Why It Matters

Real-world agent tasks involve:
- Understanding requirements
- Generating code
- Compiling successfully
- Producing correct output
- Doing so efficiently (context window usage)

This metric captures end-to-end success, not just individual capabilities.

---

## How It's Measured

### Completion Potential Score

| Factor | Calor | C# |
|:-------|:-----|:---|
| Token efficiency | Variable | Typically better |
| Compilation success | +0.20 | +0.20 |
| Complete structure | +0.05 to +0.10 | +0.05 to +0.15 |
| Has contracts | +0.05 | N/A |

Base score: 0.50 for both

### Token Efficiency Bonus

| Token Count | Calor Bonus | C# Bonus |
|:------------|:-----------|:---------|
| < 50 | +0.15 | N/A |
| < 100 | +0.10 | +0.10 |
| < 200 | +0.05 | +0.05 |

C# cap: 0.95 (slight penalty for verbosity overhead)

---

## Task Verification

For each task, the framework verifies:

```csharp
// Check required patterns are present
foreach (var pattern in task.RequiredPatterns)
{
    if (!Regex.IsMatch(output, pattern))
        return false;
}

// Check forbidden patterns are absent
foreach (var pattern in task.ForbiddenPatterns)
{
    if (Regex.IsMatch(output, pattern))
        return false;
}

// Verify compilation if required
if (task.RequiresCompilation)
{
    return compilation.Success;
}
```

---

## Efficiency Calculation

```
Efficiency = (Success ? 1.0 : 0.0) / TokensUsed × 1000
```

Higher efficiency = more success per token.

---

## Why C# Wins

### 1. Ecosystem Maturity

C# has:
- Extensive documentation
- Large code corpus for training
- Well-understood patterns
- Rich tooling support

### 2. Token Efficiency

For the same logic, C# typically uses fewer tokens:

| Task | Calor Tokens | C# Tokens | Ratio |
|:-----|:------------|:----------|:------|
| Hello World | ~25 | ~15 | 1.67x |
| FizzBuzz | ~80 | ~50 | 1.60x |
| Calculator | ~120 | ~75 | 1.60x |

More tokens = more context window usage = less room for task context.

### 3. Error Recovery

When things go wrong, C# errors are:
- More familiar to LLMs
- Easier to diagnose
- Faster to fix

---

## Task Categories

### Simple Tasks (Calor competitive)

- Hello World
- Basic arithmetic
- Simple loops

Both languages perform similarly on trivial tasks.

### Medium Tasks (C# slightly ahead)

- FizzBuzz
- Function with contracts
- File I/O

C#'s familiarity advantage appears.

### Complex Tasks (C# advantage grows)

- Multi-function programs
- Error handling
- Data structures

C#'s ecosystem and training data advantage becomes significant.

---

## Example Task

### Task Definition

```csharp
var task = new TaskDefinition
{
    Id = "fizzbuzz",
    Category = "loops",
    Description = "Print FizzBuzz for 1-100",
    Prompt = "Write FizzBuzz from 1 to 100",
    RequiredPatterns = new List<string>
    {
        @"1.*100",           // Loop range
        @"[Ff]izz",          // Contains Fizz
        @"[Bb]uzz",          // Contains Buzz
    },
    RequiresCompilation = true,
    MaxTokenBudget = 500
};
```

### Calor Solution

```
§M{m001:FizzBuzz}
§F{f001:Main:pub}
  §O{void}
  §E{cw}
  §L{for1:i:1:100:1}
    §IF{if1} (== (% i 15) 0) → §P "FizzBuzz"
    §EI (== (% i 3) 0) → §P "Fizz"
    §EI (== (% i 5) 0) → §P "Buzz"
    §EL → §P i
    §/I{if1}
  §/L{for1}
§/F{f001}
§/M{m001}
```
- Tokens: ~80
- Compiles: Yes
- Success: Yes
- Efficiency: 1.0 / 80 × 1000 = **12.5**

### C# Solution

```csharp
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
{
    if (i % 15 == 0) Console.WriteLine("FizzBuzz");
    else if (i % 3 == 0) Console.WriteLine("Fizz");
    else if (i % 5 == 0) Console.WriteLine("Buzz");
    else Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```
- Tokens: ~50
- Compiles: Yes
- Success: Yes
- Efficiency: 1.0 / 50 × 1000 = **20.0**

C# is 1.6x more token-efficient for this task.

---

## Context Window Impact

Given a typical 8K context window:

| Metric | Calor | C# |
|:-------|:-----|:---|
| Avg tokens per program | ~100 | ~60 |
| Programs fitting in context | ~80 | ~130 |
| % of context for code | Higher | Lower |
| Room for instructions | Lower | Higher |

---

## Interpretation

C# has an advantage in task completion.

This is primarily due to:
1. **Token efficiency** - More room in context window
2. **Training data** - LLMs know C# patterns better
3. **Error recovery** - C# errors are easier to fix

However, the gap is modest, and Calor's advantages in comprehension and precision may offset this in specific scenarios.

## When Calor Catches Up

Calor may perform better when:
- Tasks require understanding existing Calor code
- Contract verification is part of the task
- Precise edits are needed
- Comprehension quality matters more than speed
